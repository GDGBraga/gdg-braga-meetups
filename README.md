# How a meetup work

1. We get speakers, around 1-2 speakers per meetup;
2. The session will last around an hour;
3. We mainly would like to see what people are working on, whether it's a library, side project app, or some hack you want to share with others;
4. To be a speaker on a next meetup just send a PR to `interestedSpeakers.md` with your short bio and a very short outline of what you'd like to talk about. You can also send us an email with this info;
5. More to follow, stay tuned!
